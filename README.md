### How to compile and execute

I have implemented both the algorithms and included them under the same ipynb file.The code was written in python3 using collab
The first cell contains the Naive Backtracking algorithm implementation 
The second cell contains the Smart Backtracking Algorithm implementation

### Analysis:

* We can see thaat the Naive Backtracking algorithm is much slower in terms of computation in comparision to teh smart backtracking algorithm
* It can be concluded that although both algorithms find solutions to all the input cases provided , Smart backtracking outperforms Naive Algorithm.
